## Pricing

We charge for Skylight based on the total number of requests per month across all your apps.

Skylight is free up to the first 100,000 requests. After that, pricing starts at $20 per million requests handled, and continues according to the schedule above. As you can also see, the more you need, the lower your cost per million; built-in bulk discounting.

You can use <%= link_to "this calculator", "/pricing" %> to determine what your monthly price would be for a given request volume.

To be clear: no plans, nothing to choose. Skylight will automatically discount additional requests for you. Weâ€™re fond of simplicity.


### Billing Details

The billing page gives an overview of your current billing status.

At the top, we present the current billing period, including your total requests and price so far, along with a graph of your daily usage. Hovering over a specific bar in the usage chart will give you the specific number of requests each day.

Below that we show your current billing tier. See above for more information on tiers.

If you have multiple apps, we then show you how your usage breaks down across all of your apps.

The UI does not currently support viewing historical usage. If you need details about past billing cycles, please contact us via the in-app messenger with your request.
