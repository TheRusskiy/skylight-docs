## Quick Start

First, check that your app meets the <%= link_to "requirements", "./advanced-setup#requirements" %> to run Skylight. If so, huzzah! Carry on.

<%= render partial: "installing_the_agent" %>

1. Check in the `config/skylight.yml` file and run your standard deployment process.

Click <%= link_to "here", "./advanced-setup#installing-the-agent" %> for advanced installation procedures like setting environment variables, custom configurations, and using Skylight on another framework.

## Feature Overview

### Actionable Insights

Skylight makes it easy to understand and act on your app’s performance data:
* <%= link_to "True Response Times", "#true-response-times" %> and <%= link_to "Request Aggregation", "#aggregation-vs-sampling" %> prevent you from going on a wild goose chase.
* Sorting by <%= link_to "Agony", "./skylight-guides#agony" %> puts the endpoints most in need of improvement at the top of your list.
* <%= link_to "Heads Ups", "./skylight-guides#heads-up" %> notify you to potential code issues that may slow down your app.

## The Theory Behind Skylight

### True Response Times

<%= image_tag 'skylight/docs/features/response-times.png', alt: 'Screenshot of Response Times' %>

Your application's response times appear several places in Skylight. In most cases we talk about the numbers in one of two ways. The “problem” response time is the 95th percentile, whereas the “typical” response time is the median (50th percentile).

Most tools only show averages, which are easy to calculate but provide limited usefulness on their own. In Skylight, we always show the 95th percentile response time as well. While this takes significantly more computation on the backend to determine, it is a much, much better number to indicate real world performance.

Averages are almost useless when thinking about web performance, and in the worst case, are actually misleading. For more information, see <%= link_to "DHH’s blog post, The Problem with Averages", "http://signalvnoise.com/posts/1836-the-problem-with-averages" %>. Google, Twitter, and GitHub (to name a few) all use 95th percentile numbers when tracking performance.


### Aggregation vs. Sampling

Most other profiling tools rely on sampling to give you detailed information about endpoints. While this provides some value, it doesn’t provide you information about every request. Depending on how frequently the sample happens, it’s quite likely that it will miss spikes and unusual behavior.

In Skylight, we track information about every request. We then aggregate the data to provide a <%= link_to "representative picture of your application", "./skylight-guides#request-aggregation" %>. This means that no request is ignored, and we can give you a full and accurate picture of your application.
