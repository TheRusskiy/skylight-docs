## Quick Start

First, check that your app meets the <%= link_to "requirements", "./advanced-setup#requirements" %> to run Skylight. If so, huzzah! Carry on.

<%= render partial: "installing_the_agent" %>

Click <%= link_to "here", "./advanced-setup" %> for advanced installation procedures like setting environment variables, custom configurations, and using Skylight on a framework other than Rails.

### Manual App Creation

In some cases, you might need to set up an app on Skylight manually, including if you're using the <%= link_to "Phoenix agent", "advanced-setup#phoenix-beta" %>. Manual app creation is a way of setting up an app in Skylight _without_ having to run `bundle exec skylight setup <setup token>`, and can be an easier way of <%= link_to "setting up multiple environments", "advanced-setup#setting-up-multiple-environments" %> without having to create temporary directories.

In order to manually create an app on Skylight, you must first enable the manual app creation <%= link_to "beta feature", "./faqs#accessing-user-interface-beta-features" %>. After enabling this feature, you can navigate to your app's <%= link_to "setup screen", "/app/setup" %>, and click the "Or create the application manually." link towards the bottom of the page. Then, you'll be able to type in the name of your new app.

<%= image_tag 'skylight/docs/getting_set_up/add-an-app-manually.png', alt: 'Screenshot of adding an app manually' %>

Next, you will need to set the authentication token for your application. You will find your app's authentication token on your app's <%= link_to "settings page", "/app/settings/account" %>.

<%= image_tag 'skylight/docs/getting_set_up/authentication-set-up.png', alt: 'Screenshot of adding an app manually' %>

There are two ways to set the auth token for your Skylight app. One option is to create a <%= link_to "`config/skylight.yml`", "advanced-setup#agent-configuration" %> file, and set the authentication token for your new app within it.

<%= render partial: "default_config_file" %>

Alternatively, you can set the token as the `SKYLIGHT_AUTHENTICATION` environment variable, in which case you will not need to create a `config/skylight.yml` file.

Once you have set an auth token in either one of these two ways, you can <%= link_to "deploy your application", "./advanced-setup#deployment" %> to production. After deploying, be sure to check your Skylight dashboard; you should begin seeing request data appear shortly!

## Feature Overview

### Actionable Insights

Skylight makes it easy to understand and act on your app’s performance data:
* <%= link_to "True Response Times", "#true-response-times" %> and <%= link_to "Request Aggregation", "#aggregation-vs-sampling" %> prevent you from going on a wild goose chase.
* Sorting by <%= link_to "Agony", "./skylight-guides#agony" %> puts the endpoints most in need of improvement at the top of your list.
* <%= link_to "Heads Ups", "./skylight-guides#heads-up" %> notify you to potential code issues that may slow down your app.

## The Theory Behind Skylight

### Answers, Not Data

Rather than bog you down with a zillion charts and graphs, Skylight turns performance data into actionable insights, so you spend less time diagnosing and more time improving.

Our <%= link_to "user interface", "./skylight-guides" %> is pretty and fun to use. We've optimized it to provide maximum insight with minimal distractions. We work very hard to make Skylight's UI approachable, with the attitude that providing more data is a worse experience if it can't be presented correctly.

We focus on the features that actually help you improve your app, such as <%= link_to "Agony", "./skylight-guides#agony" %> to prioritize improvements, <%= link_to "heads up", "./skylight-guides#heads-up" %> to spot potential code mistakes, and the <%= link_to "Event Sequence", "./skylight-guides#event-sequence" %> to determine where your app is spending the most time.

Don't struggle to learn why your app is slow. Get answers with Skylight.

### True Response Times

<%= image_tag 'skylight/docs/features/response-times.png', alt: 'Screenshot of Response Times' %>

Your application's response times appear several places in Skylight. In most cases we talk about the numbers in one of two ways. The “problem” response time is the 95th percentile, whereas the “typical” response time is the median (50th percentile).

Most tools only show averages, which are easy to calculate but provide limited usefulness on their own. In Skylight, we always show the 95th percentile response time as well. While this takes significantly more computation on the backend to determine, it is a much, much better number to indicate real world performance.

Averages are almost useless when thinking about web performance, and in the worst case, are actually misleading. For more information, see <%= link_to "DHH’s blog post, The Problem with Averages", "http://signalvnoise.com/posts/1836-the-problem-with-averages" %>. Google, Twitter, and GitHub (to name a few) all use 95th percentile numbers when tracking performance.

### Aggregation vs. Sampling

Most other profiling tools rely on sampling to give you detailed information about endpoints. While this provides some value, it doesn’t provide you information about every request. Depending on how frequently the sample happens, it’s quite likely that it will miss spikes and unusual behavior.

In Skylight, we track information about every request. We then aggregate the data to provide a <%= link_to "representative picture of your application", "./skylight-guides#request-aggregation" %>, dropping only the outliers. This means that no request is ignored, and we can give you a full and accurate picture of your application.
