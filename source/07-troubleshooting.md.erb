title: Troubleshooting
description: Having trouble with the agent? Take a look here.
---

Below are some troubleshooting steps you can try. If you’re still having trouble, please contact us via email at [support@skylight.io](mailto:support@skylight.io).

## Skylight Doctor

If you're having issues setting up Skylight, run `skylight doctor` in your production terminal. You should see something like this as the output:

```
Checking for Rails
  Rails application detected

Checking for native agent
  Native agent installed

Checking for valid configuration
  Configuration is invalid
    authentication token required
```

**Pro-tip:** On Heroku you can access your production terminal with `heroku run bash`.

If you don't see any helpful information after running `skylight doctor`, be sure to check out the rest of our troubleshooting guide below.

## Data Not Reporting

### I deployed my application, but no data is appearing in Skylight.

#### Is your environment correct?

Verify that the application is running with the correct Rails environment. By default, the agent only starts in the `production` environment, but this can be configured.

To learn how to change what environments Skylight starts in, see <%= link_to "Railtie Environments", "./advanced-setup#rails" %>.


#### Is the `skylight` gem in the right group?

Verify that, in your app’s `Gemfile`, you’ve added the `skylight` gem to a group that will be installed in production. For example, if you add `skylight` to the `development` group, it will not run when you deploy to production.


#### If you're using Sinatra or Grape without Rails, did you follow the installation instructions?

 * <%= link_to "Sinatra Instructions", "./advanced-setup#sinatra-1" %>
 * <%= link_to "Grape Instructions", "./advanced-setup#grape-1" %>


#### Is the sockfile path writable?

By default, Skylight uses your Rails tmp path as the sockfile directory. In the event that this path isn’t writable you should set `daemon.sockdir_path` in your <%= link_to "config", "./advanced-setup#setting-configuration-variables" %>.


#### Are you using NFS, possibly with Vagrant?

Skylight’s socket file can’t be located on an NFS mount. Set `daemon.sockdir_path` in your <%= link_to "config", "./advanced-setup#setting-configuration-variables" %> to a non-NFS path.


#### If you're running Unicorn, did you restart your master?

To make sure Skylight is activated, you may need to restart your Unicorn masters.

### Skylight was working before, but now I’m only seeing “No requests in this time range” when viewing an app.

You might see this bug if the agent running in your Rails app stops reporting performance data to Skylight. If you were able to see data before but it has stopped working recently, restarting your server will usually fix the issue.

If the agent encounters multiple errors in a short span of time, it will shut itself down. This is done out of an abundance of caution to ensure that a potential bug in the agent doesn’t bring down your app in production.

We are working to add more logging to the agent so we can better diagnose what causes the agent to shutdown and recover gracefully in the event of an error. If you find this is happening regularly, please let us know!

### I’m using Heroku but no data is showing up in Skylight.

First, make sure that there is traffic to your application. If your Rails app is handling requests, you should start to see data in Skylight in just a few minutes.

We have received reports of problems running on the `cedar-10` stack. You should upgrade to the `cedar-14` stack.

If your app is running and has traffic, but you’re still not seeing anything in Skylight, verify that the `skylight` gem is installed and running properly.

Make sure you are using the latest version of the Skylight gem. In the directory for your Rails app, run this command:

```
bundle list | grep skylight
```

You should see something like the following output:

```
* skylight (version number)
```

If the gem is installed and up-to-date, the next step is to verify that it is running correctly:

 1. In one terminal window, run `heroku logs -t` to show the application log.
 1. In another terminal window, run `heroku restart` to restart the app.

Keep an eye on the log terminal. If you see an error message stating that the Skylight agent is missing an authentication token, verify that you have <%= link_to "configured Skylight in Heroku", "./advanced-setup#heroku" %> properly.


## Platform Issues

### The Skylight native extension wasn’t found, but my platform claims to be supported.

To avoid taking your production application down due to an installation failure, Skylight does not raise an exception when it can’t install the native agent. Currently, we support Linux 2.6.18+ and Mac OS X 10.8+. If you’re running a compatible OS and still see errors, try running your application with `SKYLIGHT_REQUIRED=true`. This will cause Skylight to raise an exception when the native agent is missing. This exception may be useful in troubleshooting the problem. If you need help, send this to us at [support@skylight.io](mailto:support@skylight.io).

## GitHub Integration Issues

### I followed an email invitation and signed up with GitHub. How come I don't see any apps when I log in?

This is actually a known bug, but it's quite rare these days and we've had trouble reproducing it, so have had trouble fixing it. Please do email [support@skylight.io](mailto:support@skylight.io) and let us know exactly what steps you took when signing up, especially if there were any errors or issues along the way, or if you refreshed the invitation signup page at all before clicking "sign up with GitHub." Any information about anything out of the ordinary helps!

In the meantime, you can ask the person who initially invited you to send another invitation to the email address associated with your account. This will add you to the app automatically and you should have no further issues.

### I'm trying to add a repo to my Skylight app but I don't see the field to do so.

There are a few reasons why this might happen.

1. You are not the owner of the app on Skylight. You may contact the owner to have them add a repo to the app, or have them transfer ownership to you (this would entail transferring billing to you as well, so you may not want to do that).
1. You are the owner, but are not logged in with GitHub. We need to verify your credentials, so be sure you are logged in via GitHub.

### I'm having problems connecting my Skylight app to a personal GitHub repo.

Sorry, right now we only support repos that are connected to an organization, though we may allow use of personal repos in the future. Shoot us an email at [support@skylight.io](mailto:support@skylight.io) to let us know if this feature is important to you!


## Skylight Errors

The Skylight agent will log errors to `log/skylight.log` or on Heroku in STDOUT (Look for lines starting with `[SKYLIGHT]`).

### Event Errors

#### `failed to instrument span; msg=native Trace#start_span failed`

This error occurs when an event is too complex for Skylight's agent to track. Here are a few potential causes for this issue:
1. **The request itself is very complex.** For example, requests that generate a significant number of SQL queries have been known to trigger this error. Be sure to check out our <%= link_to "Performance Tips", "./performance-tips" %> to reduce the complexity of your request.
1. **Your custom instrumentation is overly complex.** Be sure to follow our <%= link_to "custom instrumentation best practices", "./getting-more-from-skylight#custom-instrumentation-best-practices" %>.

### SQL Query Errors

#### `internal error: failed to lex SQL query`

These errors indicate that the agent is unable to parse a SQL query in your application. There errors won't prevent your application from operating, though they will reduce the information that we can display in the UI for these queries. They will be displayed in the <%= link_to "Event Sequence", "./skylight-guides#event-sequence" %> as simply "SQL", not the full sanitized query. There are a few reasons why you might be seeing this error:
1. **Your query might be too complex for Skylight's SQL lexer.** Right now we can only have 1024 items in an event trace. Very complex queries might put your event over that limit. We plan to increase this number in the near future.
1. **You might be using a non-standard SQL syntax.** We support most valid standard SQL, with optimizations for Postgres and MySQL. Custom syntax extensions may not be supported. For example, the agent doesn't currently support square brackets allowed by MS SQL.

When running across this error, please feel free to <%= link_to "report it", "./contributing#reporting-bugs-and-submitting-feedback" %> so we can learn what queries we're failing to parse.

## Other Issues

### I ran a memory profiler. Why are so many object allocations attributed to Skylight?

Memory profiler gems like <%= link_to "`memory_profiler`", "https://github.com/SamSaffron/memory_profiler" %> and <%= link_to "`derailed`", "https://github.com/schneems/derailed_benchmarks" %> generally use Ruby's <%= link_to "`ObjectSpace`", "https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/ObjectSpace.html" %>—a really nifty way to get information about all the objects allocated in your Ruby application that is great for troubleshooting memory issues.

Digging into the source of both `derailed` and `memory_profiler` (which is used by derailed), we discovered the following line (<%= link_to "source", "https://github.com/SamSaffron/memory_profiler/blob/6ff1bb359e5dc0ff15603cb71687f6ee6d75cfc6/lib/memory_profiler/reporter.rb#L93" %>):

```ruby
file = ObjectSpace.allocation_sourcefile(obj)
```

This line looks at an object and asks `ObjectSpace` who caused it to be allocated. As it turns out, objects allocated at require time are attributed to the file that calls the original `Kernel#require` method.

Now, this is all well and good except for one small problem: Skylight <%= link_to "overwrites", "https://github.com/skylightio/skylight-ruby/blob/2ccc1c573e7b7d17e24c0afb238f42c2e0a650a5/lib/skylight/probes.rb#L77-L91" %> `Kernel#require` in order to properly install probes. This means that it is Skylight that calls the original `Kernel#require`, not whatever other gem is _really_ doing the require. So, as soon as Skylight is loaded, every future `require` call is attributed to Skylight.

Skylight isn't the only library to do this. ActiveSupport has a <%= link_to "similar hook", "https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.2.2/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb#L272-L276" %> in it's `Loadable` module that is included into `Object`. Without Skylight, it would be ActiveSupport taking the blame. However, because this hook uses `super`, it calls to the superclass `Kernel` that is now the version that Skylight created.

Even RubyGems itself gets in on the <%= link_to "overwriting behavior", "https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/lib/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb#L38-L47" %>. Though, if you use Bundler (as everyone is), this is <%= link_to "actually reversed", "https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/bc87d05ff3565551ec3b2d32a5c08aa3cf24beb8/lib/bundler/rubygems_integration.rb#L254-L264" %>.

So there you have it, run `derailed` without Bundler and you'll see RubyGems blamed for your requires. Add in Bundler and the correct files will get blamed. Bring in ActiveSupport and then ActiveSupport will be blamed. Include Skylight and blame will shift to us. Good times!

So what's the moral here? Know your tools. `ObjectSpace` and the libraries that use it do some really useful things. They aren't perfect, but they're open source. Read the code and find out a bit about how they work and you'll be able to put them to better use!

### What if I need to load the Skylight gem before Rails?

Skylight performs setup when the gem is required, at which time Rails will be detected and tapped into. However, you may find you have to manually require `skylight/railtie` if you need to load the Skylight gem before Rails.
