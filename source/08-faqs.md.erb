## General Questions

### Is Skylight compatible with other profilers and monitoring tools?

Skylight plays nice with other profilers and monitoring solutions, including New Relic. Many of our customers run multiple tools with success! Go ahead and compare :)


## Security

Skylight follows generally acceptable security practices. Most importantly, we don't store any sensitive data ourselves.

### What data does my app send to Skylight?

When you install the Skylight agent in your app, it will send the following information to our servers:
* Endpoint names (without parameter values), e.g, what’s in `rake routes`
* Generic descriptions of different items in your call stack
* Sanitized SQL queries (see below)
* Response times
* Generic metadata about your application such as OS and framework version.

### Will my users' private data be sent to Skylight?

Nope. All performance metrics are scrubbed of private data by the agent running on your server before anything is ever sent our way. Skylight doesn't collect sensitive data like request param or database query values.

In fact, scrubbing parameters and values from the data your app sends is what allows Skylight to aggregate your data, providing you with an accurate view of your app’s performance on the whole.

For example, Skylight will remove variables from your SQL queries and display aggregated queries in the UI along with average durations and allocations:

<%= image_tag 'skylight/docs/faqs/sanitized-sql-query.png', alt: 'Screenshot of a sanitized SQL query' %>

### Can I read your privacy policy?

Sure! You can find our Privacy Policy <%= link_to "here", "/privacy" %>.


## Feature Requests

### Can I get alerts when my performance changes?

While we don't yet give you up to the minute alerts, you can get insight into your app's weekly changes by signing up for Trends emails in your <%= link_to "account settings", "/app/settings/account" %>. Down the road, we may add more immediate alerting when significant slowdowns occur in your app.


### Can I track deploys?

Soon! We've got work underway to make this happen. Sign up for our daily emails in your <%= link_to "account settings", "/app/settings/account" %> to get the latest scoop on development.


### Can I instrument background jobs like Sidekiq?

Background job instrumentation is a high priority for us. The technical aspect of it isn't too hard, but the big blocker is the UI. We don't just want to throw the background jobs into the regular UI since in most cases, they'll take much longer than normal requests and won't have the same immediate impact on the end-user.

But, we ourselves use Sidekiq and agree that it would be great to have more insight into our background jobs performance.


### Can I administer my apps with organizations?

Not yet, but it's something we've got on our roadmap. Our current thought it something based around GitHub organizations. If you've got any thoughts on this, we'd love to hear them.


### Do you plan to add error tracking?

Right now we've chosen to focus on providing you the most useful performance information we can. That said, in the future we'd love to provide some basic notifications, especially around increased error rates. For more robust error tracking, we recommend a dedicated tool like Bugsnag.


### Do you have this feature that New Relic has?

New Relic has lots of features we don't have but, in our opinion, they're not all that useful. We've decided to focus on making sure that everything we show you provides immediate value. Our customers find that it's easier to make sense of our UI and to get _actionable_ information from it. Sure, we could throw more stats in, but sometimes less is more.


## I've got a different question.

We would love to hear your questions. Just shoot us an email at [support@skylight.io](mailto:support@skylight.io) or use the in-app messenger ("?" in the bottom right of the web UI). See our section on <%= link_to "Submitting Feedback", "./contributing#reporting-bugs-and-submitting-feedback" %> for more details.
