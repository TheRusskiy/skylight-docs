## App Management

### Sharing an app with others

Anyone with access to an app can grant access to others. You can do this on your application-specific settings page by adding the email address of the invitee.

<%= image_tag 'skylight/docs/faqs/adding-collaborators.png', alt: 'adding collaborators' %>

Note that invites are currently app-specific only. If you want to grant access to multiple apps, repeat the step above on the settings page of each app.

The user will receive an invite via email. If they don't yet have a Skylight account, that email invite will include a link to sign up. Once they complete the steps, they'll see the app inside their account.

You can add unlimited users/collaborators to your app.


### Transferring an app to another account

Just contact us via the in-app messenger to request a transfer.


### Deleting an app

Only app owners can delete apps. To do so, visit the settings page and find the app you'd like to delete listed in the left sidebar. Click on the app name to visit the settings page for that app. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the link that says "Delete this application..."


### Removing yourself from a shared app

A shared app is simply an app you have access to but do not own. You can remove yourself from a shared app, if need be. This might be good if you have many shared apps and one of them is no longer relevant to you.

To remove yourself from an app, visit the settings page and find the app listed in the left sidebar. Click on the app name to visit the settings page for that app. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the link that says "Remove myself from this application..."


## Billing

### Pricing

Skylight pricing is based on the total number of requests per month across all your apps.

Skylight is free up to the first 100,000 requests. After that, pricing starts at $20 per million requests handled, and continues according to the schedule above. As you can also see, the more you need, the lower your cost per million; built-in bulk discounting.

You can use <%= link_to "this calculator", "/pricing" %> to determine what your monthly price would be for a given request volume.

To be clear: no plans, nothing to choose. Skylight will automatically discount additional requests for you. Weâ€™re fond of simplicity.


### Billing Details

The billing page gives an overview of your current billing status.

<%= image_tag 'skylight/docs/getting_to_know_skylight/billing-graph.png', alt: 'Screenshot of current billing status' %>

At the top, we present the current billing period, including your total requests and price so far, along with a graph of your daily usage. Hovering over a specific bar in the usage chart will give you the specific number of requests each day.

Below that we show your current billing tier. See <%= link_to "the pricing page", "/pricing" %> for more information on tiers.

If you have multiple apps, we then show you how your usage breaks down across all of your apps.

<%= image_tag 'skylight/docs/getting_to_know_skylight/billing-apps.png', alt: "Screenshot of usage per app" %>

The UI does not currently support viewing historical usage. If you need details about past billing cycles, please contact us via the in-app messenger with your request.
