## Compatibility with Other Profilers and Monitoring Tools

Skylight plays nice with other profilers and monitoring solutions, including New Relic. Many of our customers run multiple tools with success! Go ahead and compare :)


## Resource Overhead

The Skylight agent is written primarily in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){:target="_blank"}, a systems programming language on par with C. This means we have a very low overhead so itâ€™s safe to run Skylight in production, even in memory limited environments like Heroku.
