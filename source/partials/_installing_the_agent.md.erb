1. Add Skylight to your Gemfile. Be sure to include it in all of your environments.
```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "skylight"
```

1. Get your setup token from <%= link_to "http://skylight.io/app/setup", "/app/setup" %>.

1. Then run:
```
bundle install
bundle exec skylight setup {SETUP_TOKEN}
```
This will automatically generate your `config/skylight.yml` file.
