1. Add Skylight to your Gemfile. Be sure to include it in all of your environments.
    ```ruby
    # Gemfile
    gem "skylight"
    ```

1. Get your setup token from <%= link_to "http://skylight.io/app/setup", "/app/setup" %>.

1. Then run the following commands in your terminal:
    ```
    bundle install
    bundle exec skylight setup <setup token>
    ```
    This will automatically generate your <%= link_to "`config/skylight.yml`", "advanced-setup#agent-configuration" %> file.

      type: 'important',
      note: <<~NOTE
              The contents of the skylight.yml file should be considered secret,
              so if your application is open-source, you will not want to commit it
              to your repo. Click #{link_to "here", "./advanced-setup#setting-authentication-tokens"}
              to learn how to set an environment variable instead.

1. <%= link_to "Deploy your application", "./advanced-setup#deployment" %> to production.
