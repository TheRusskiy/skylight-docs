1. Visit the Skylight app to get your <%= link_to "setup token", "/app/setup" %>.

1. Add Skylight to _all_ environments in your Gemfile.
    ```ruby
    # Gemfile
    gem "skylight"
    ```

1. Run the following commands in your _development environment_:
   <!-- NOTE: This isn't actually ruby but the "shell" code formatting wasn't as nice -->
    ```ruby
    # Shell
    bundle install
    bundle exec skylight setup <setup token>
    ```
    This will automatically generate your <%= link_to "`config/skylight.yml`", "advanced-setup#agent-configuration" %> file.

    <%= render partial: "note", indent_level: 4, locals: {
      type: 'important',
      note: <<~NOTE
              The contents of the skylight.yml file should be considered secret,
              so if your application is open source, you will not want to commit it
              to your repo. Click #{link_to "here", "./advanced-setup#setting-authentication-tokens"}
              to learn how to set an environment variable instead.
            NOTE
    }
    %>

1. <%= link_to "Deploy your application", "./advanced-setup#deployment" %> to production.
