title: Markdown Styleguide
description: This one line description shows up on the Support index page. It also shows up as the first paragraph of the chapter. Do not make it two lines!
---

## Section Header
Content of the markdown styleguide. Here's an introductory paragraph for this section. `<h1>`s will be generated by the `title` property above, so don't use those.

### Subsection Header
Here's a subsection with some content. It should show up in the TOC.

#### Sub-subsection Header
Here's even more subsectiony content. It will not show up in the TOC.

## ERB
We've added some ERB functionality to our version of markdown.

### Image Tags
You can use `image_tag`s.
<%= image_tag 'skylight/docs/support-monsters.svg', alt: 'Here is an image with an alt tag' %>
This is a paragraph after an image tag.

### Link Tos
This is an <%= link_to "external", 'http://www.example.com' %> link.

This is an <%= link_to "internal", './a-aardvark-chapter' %> link.

This is a link to an <%= link_to "anchor", '#header-1' %> tag.

### Partials
<%= render partial: "test_partial" %>

## General Markdown Shenanigans
Here is some general markdown stuff that should render properly.
