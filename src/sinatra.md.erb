Skylight supports Sinatra applications out of the box. What this means is that you
can use the same Skylight gem for Sinatra apps and Rails apps.

## Sinatra in Rails

If your Sinatra app is mounted in Rails, all you have to do is require the correct
probes:

```rb
# config/application.rb
config.skylight.probes += %w(sinatra tilt sequel)
```

See the [Rails configuration instructions](/agent#railtie) for more information.


## Standalone Sinatra

Skylight works just as well in standalone Sinatra apps, though the insructions
are just a touch more involved.

Sinatra apps usually do not require all gems in the `Gemfile`, so you will want
to add a line like this to your main file:

```rb
require "skylight/sinatra"
```

You will also need to boot up the Skylight agent explicitly:

```rb
Skylight.start!
```

Since you probably don't want to instrument your app locally, you should set up a
conditional to ensure this this is only run in production environments.

You don't need to install any middleware manually, or do anything with unicorn
forking settings.

When working with Sinatra, you'll want to use environment variables to
configure Skylight (most notably the authentication token). Skylight doesn't
support YAML-file configuration in Sinatra apps.

The authentication token will be emitted into `config/skylight.yml` when you
run `bundle exec skylight setup`, and you should provide it to your production
app as `SKYLIGHT_AUTHENTICATION`.
