title: Sinatra Apps

Skylight supports Sinatra applications out of the box. What this means is that you
can use the same Skylight gem for Sinatra apps and Rails apps.

## Sinatra in Rails

If your Sinatra app is mounted in Rails, all you have to do is require the correct
probes:

```rb
# config/application.rb
config.skylight.probes += %w(sinatra tilt sequel)
```

See the [Rails configuration instructions](/agent#railtie) for more information.


## Standalone Sinatra

Skylight works just as well in standalone Sinatra apps, though the insructions
are just a touch more involved.

Sinatra apps usually do not require all gems in the `Gemfile`, so you will want
to add a line like this to your main file:

```rb
require "skylight/sinatra"
```

You will also need to boot up the Skylight agent explicitly:

```rb
Skylight.start!
```

(If you want to load your configuration from a file instead of from ENV, you
can use `Skylight.start!(file: PATH_TO_CONFIG)`.)

You generally do not want to run Skylight in development mode, and the most common
way to do that in Sinatra apps is to use the `:production` environment.

```rb
configure :production do
  require "skylight/sinatra"
  Skylight.start!
end
```

You don't need to install any middleware manually, or do anything with unicorn
forking settings.
