Currently, Skylight supports the following:

* **Ruby** versions 1.9.3, 2.0.0, JRuby 1.6 and above.
* **Rails** versions 3.x and 4.x

Although we currently only officially support the Ruby on Rails
framework, it is possible to get Skylight working with any Rack
application with [custom
instrumentation](/agent#custom-instrumentation).
