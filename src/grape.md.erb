> NOTE: Grape support requires the 0.8 beta gem.

Skylight supports Grape applications out of the box. What this means is that you
can use the same Skylight gem for Grape apps and Rails apps.

## Grape on Rails

If your Grape app is mounted in Rails and is version 0.13+, it works out of the
box with no further configuration! Congrats!

If you're running 0.10 - 0.12 all you have to do is require the following probe:

```rb
# config/application.rb
config.skylight.probes += ['grape']
```

See the [Rails configuration instructions](/agent#railtie) for more information.

## Grape on Sinatra

If your Grape app is mounted in a Sinatra app, first follow the [Sinatra
instructions](/sinatra).

If you're running Grape 0.13+, that's all you need to do. For versions 0.10 -
0.12, you'll also want to add this to your main file:

```rb
require 'skylight/probes/grape'
```

## Standalone Grape

Grape apps usually do not require all gems in the `Gemfile`, so you'll want to
begin by adding a line like this to your main file:

```rb
require "skylight"
```

(If you're running grape 0.10 - 0.12 or earlier, you'll also need to explicitly
require the probe: `require 'skylight/probes/grape'`.)

You will also need to boot up the Skylight agent explicitly.

```rb
Skylight.start!
```

Finally, you'll want to install the Skylight middleware in your base Grape or
Rack app with:

```rb
use Skylight::Middleware
```
