We bill for Skylight based on the total number of requests across 
all your apps. The levels look like this:

Skylight is free up to the first 100,000 requests. After that, 
pricing starts at $20 per million requests handled, and continues 
according to the schedule above. As you can also see, the more you 
need, the lower your cost per million; built in bulk discounting.

To be clear, no plans, nothing to choose. Skylight will automatically 
discount additional requests for you. We're fond of simplicity.
