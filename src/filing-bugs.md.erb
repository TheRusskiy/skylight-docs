title: Filing Bugs
---

Filing bugs and submitting feedback from within Skylight is easy! If you click on your name in the top right corner, you'll see the menu item <b>Report a Bug</b>. This will bring up a box in which you can provide your feedback. Simple as that :)

<%= thumbnail 'filing-bugs/report-bug.png' %>

## Include Attachments

The box will also give you the ability to submit attachments with your communication, if relevant (see the little paperclip icon in the top right).

<%= thumbnail 'filing-bugs/feedback-window.png' %>

## View Your History

If you've submitted feedback and bugs on multiple occasions, you'll also be able to use this box to view your historical communications.

You can access your history by clicking on this icon:

<%= thumbnail 'filing-bugs/access-history.png' %>

And that'll give you access to something that looks like this:
