title: Filing Bugs
---

Filing bugs and submitting feedback from within Skylight is easy! Find the floating question mark in the
bottom right of the screen... and, well, that's pretty much it :p

<%= thumbnail 'filing-bugs/report-bug.png' %>

This will bring up a pop-up for sending us your thoughts and concerns.

## Include Attachments

The box will also give you the ability to submit attachments with your communication, if relevant (see the little paperclip icon in the top right).

<%= thumbnail 'filing-bugs/feedback-window.png' %>

## View Your History

If you've submitted feedback and bugs on multiple occasions, you'll also be able to use this box to view your historical communications.

You can access your history by clicking on this icon:

<%= thumbnail 'filing-bugs/access-history.png' %>

And that'll give you access to something that looks like this:

<%= thumbnail 'filing-bugs/history.png' %>

In addition to being able to access your communications here, you'll be notified in two other ways:

* If a response has been sent, and you're in Skylight, the box will pop up again showing you your response
* Alternatively, that box will pop up again next time you log in
* You'll also receive a copy of any responses via email

Lastly, you can always email us at [support@skylight.io](mailto:support@skylight.io).
