title: Getting started
---

It should only take a few minutes to get started with Skylight. If at
anytime you get stuck, send us an email at support@skylight.io or join
our IRC channel.

## Requirements

<%= partial "shared/requirements" %>

## Install the agent

Add the following to your Gemfile:

~~~ ruby
gem "skylight"
~~~

Then run the following command in your terminal window:

~~~
bundle install
~~~

The agent is now installed into your Rails application.

## Registering the application

Once you have the Skylight agent installed into your application, you
have to register your application with us. To do this, run the following
command:

~~~
bundle exec skylight setup
~~~

If this is the first time that you have run this command, you will be
prompted to enter your email and password.

The setup command will generate a configuration file at
`config/skylight.yml`. By default, it includes the newly created
Skylight ID for the application as well as an API authentication token
that will be used to report data to us.

If you are currently logged into your [Skylight
account](https://skylight.io/app), you will notice that the app will
transition into a state waiting for data.

Also, the Skylight application will transition into the application and
indicate that it is waiting for data. The next step is to deploy your
application.

## Deploy

Deploy your applications with the changes that you made. You will need
to ensure that the Skylight configuration is included with the deployed
application. There are a few ways to do this. The easiest is to just
commit the skylight.yml file with your application.

You may also configure the Skylight agent using environment variables. This is
the prefered configuration mechanism for environments like Heroku. The
[configuration](/agent#configuration) section covers this in more detail.

> By default, the Skylight agent only activates itself in the **production**
> environment. [See how to configure this](/agent#configuration).

Once the application restarts in production, assuming that everything is
properly configured, it should start sending data to us. It takes about
30 seconds for the data to get processed.

If you deployed but the Skylight UI does not indicate that it is
receiving data, then there is most likely a configuration problem. See
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for more help there.

## What's next

Your application should not be successfully setup with Skylight. You can
start poking around the [UI](https://skylight.io/app), or read some
[quick documentation](/app) on how to use Skylight to help debug
performance problems.

If you hit any problems at all, do not hestiate to send us an email at
[support@skylight.io](mailto:support@skylight.io). Also, we have an IRC
channel setup on the Freenode servers. The channel is **#skylightio**.
Come provide feedback, ask questions, or just hangout.
