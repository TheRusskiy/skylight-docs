title: RPM Billing
---

You might notice that some of your RPMs are actually higher than 
the RPM listed as your peak on the billing page; this is a feature, 
not a bug :p This is because we only bill for the 99th percentile. 
In practice that means:

* There are ~31 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes = ~44,640 minutes in a month 
window.
* Your top 447 minutes fall outside the 99th percentile.
* We don't bill you for those; so the RPM you're seeing on the billing page as 
your highest peak represents the RPM of your 448th busiest minute.

We do this because we don't want customers experiencing extreme spikes 
in billing along with unexpected but short bursts in traffic. It helps 
smooth the curves and make your monthly bills more predictable.

## No data available

This has another side effect: when you start each month, your billing page 
will reflect that you have 0 RPM until you hit your 448th minute. This is 
because the first 447 are free. Once you pass that window, the data on your 
billing page will give you an accurate picture of your highest RPM at any 
given point.

When you're in that 447 minute window, you'll see something like this on 
your billing page:

## Setting a cap

Remember that if you're concerned about costs getting higher than 
you're comfortable with, you've always got the option to set a billing/RPM cap.

Hit the *Enable Billing Cap* button to activate and display the cap slides, and 
you'll see something like this: 

<%= thumbnail 'rpm-billing/set-billing-cap.png' %>

Once you've chosen the Peak RPM / Max Bill you're comfortable with, click on 
*Set Billing Cap* and you're good to go. We'll shoot you an email if you you 
hit or pass your peak, and give you an opportunity to decide how to proceed.
